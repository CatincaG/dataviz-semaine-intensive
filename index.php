            <p>In Europe, gender equality is guaranteed by laws and charters. In recent years, we have been talking a lot about it and there are more and more demonstrations. Action is being taken and we are led to believe that everything is going well.</p>
            <p>But even in 2020 and in Europe, these inequalities are still shocking. On a familial, professional or political level, women are still largely disadvantaged.</p>
